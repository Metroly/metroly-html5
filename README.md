Grunt Setup
=====

Compiling
======

To compile scripts using r.js:


- ```chmod +x build/build.sh```

- ```r.js -o build/app.build.js```

CSS
======

- in CSS folder when you want to add CSS for a new feature, just add
```@import 'my_new_file_name.css'``` instead of working in one huge file. Later we will compile it all into one big file.
